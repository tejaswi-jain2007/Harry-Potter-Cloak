# Harry-Potter-Cloak
Just launched my Harry Potterâ€“inspired Invisible Cloak project! Built with Python, OpenCV, Flask, and a magical HTML/CSS/JS frontend, it brings real-time invisibility with a themed UI, house selector, animated spell effects, and sound cues. Run locally, capture your background, wrap yourself in a cloak, and enjoy Hogwarts-style magic on your webcam
